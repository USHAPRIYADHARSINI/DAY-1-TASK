HTTP(HYPERTEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL)
	It is an application protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia, information system 
that allows user to communicate data on world wide web.
	It is a request response protocol (client- server)
	Uses TCP(transmission control protocol) for the connection
	GET  and HEAD are the request methods to perform various tasks
	
HTTP 1.1 
	It works on textual format
	There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it dosen"t get all resources
	It uses request resource inlining for use getting multiple pages
	It compresses data by itself


HTTP 2.0
	Its the latest version than HTTP1.1
	It works on the binary protocol
	It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests
	It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages
	It uses HPACK for data compression

Therefore, HTTP 2.0 provides with the better and fast result.
